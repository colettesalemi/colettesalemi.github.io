I'm an economist working at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, Canada. I graduated with a PhD in Applied Economics from the University of Minnesota in 2022. I use GIS data and household microdata to empirically study population-environment interactions.

My research largely focuses on two themes:

The economics of forced displacement**: the impacts of refugee camps on markets, host populations, and landscapes; environmental quality in refugee camp areas; attitudes towards refugees. 

Adoption of clean technologies**: barriers to adoption as well as impacts. Currently focused on improved cookstoves and heat pumps.

Other ongoing projects cover a range of topics, from farmer response to locust swarms in Ethiopia to environmental justice and pollution exposure in Canada.
